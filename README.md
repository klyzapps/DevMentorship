# DevMentorship

## What I want to get out of this
- To utilize the experience of a dev with 15+ years of experience
  - I want to uncover things that make code better
    - Things that you can't pick up from a book
  - Developer best practices
  - Pairing practice
  - the expectation behind development
    - What someone is expecting for a project
    - real world experience

### Specific areas to target
- Project organization
  - Files
  - structurally (class wise)
- Testing
  - Not necessarily test driven development
    - Unit testing
    - Continuous testing
      - So that project can work with continuous integration
- Programming Best Practice
  - General + Specific knowledge on how to write better code/ be a better developer
  - Project time

## Plan
- Work on a project then go over it
  - Build on top of it
- Will be Mentoring Jonny Calvert
  - meet for 30min every other week
